== Keas Console Prototype

The Console prototype is a derivative of M.Hartl's Rails Tutorial, altered to show a stand-alone
administrative console. The Authentication and authorization models have been altered significantly
from the tutorial, the models have been expanded to encompass most of the Keas models and
associations, accessed remotely on a replica database. The [rspec] tests have been altered to suit 
the new functionality and altered access control.

In addition to the substance of the tutorial, this prototype contains examples of the following:

- remote access to MySQL database (requires native mysql gem install)
- optimized non-SQL access to relational table data
- replication of the Keas model associations for remote access
- use of a local table (Admin) associated with remote tables through associations
- caching for expensive pages
- Google graphics library examples (both Javascript and Flash)
- production deployment (heroku) of heterogeneous data (local and remote)

The 'super admin' login is: admin@keas.com pw:foobar, it's associated with league 1 (Keas Summer Challenge).
From this admin you can update/delete/add admins in the local database, which are associated with the data
in the Keas database via league, division, challenge, et al.

Other admins currently setup (same pw): admin@pfizer.com, admin@bechtel.com
